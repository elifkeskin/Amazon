# Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analysis & Modelling

## üìù Business Problem

Kozmos, a company specializing in home textiles and daily wear, sells its products on Amazon. To boost sales and improve product features, Kozmos aims to analyze customer reviews, identify complaints, and enhance its offerings accordingly.

## üéØ Project Goal

- Perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews to label each comment as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Build a classification model using the labeled data to automatically predict the sentiment of new reviews.

## üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset consists of customer reviews for Kozmos products sold on Amazon.

### Data Fields

- **Star:** Number of stars given to the product (rating).
- **Helpful:** Number of people who found the comment helpful.
- **Title:** Short title or summary of the comment.
- **Review:** Full text of the customer‚Äôs comment on the product.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Steps

1. **Data Loading & Exploration:**  
   - Import the dataset and perform initial exploratory data analysis.

2. **Text Preprocessing:**  
   - Clean and preprocess the review texts (remove punctuation, stopwords, etc.).
   - Tokenize and normalize the text data.

3. **Sentiment Labeling:**  
   - Tag each review with a sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral) using sentiment analysis techniques.

4. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Create features from the text and metadata (e.g., star rating, helpful count).

5. **Model Building:**  
   - Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or deep learning models) to predict sentiment labels.

6. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

7. **Insights & Recommendations:**  
   - Analyze the results to identify common complaints and areas for product improvement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Used

- **pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy:** Numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn:** Machine learning and model evaluation.
- **nltk / spaCy / TextBlob:** Natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
- **matplotlib / seaborn:** Data visualization.
